# Portfolio with Express

I created a website using HTML, CSS and utilzing my knowledge of Node.js, Express.js and backend server setup. I created a navigation bar with working links to the other pages. I created a card displaying my image and information about myself. I also created ways to display my portfolio and a form in which potential employers can contact me.
